    "# Histopathologic Cancer Detection\n",
    "\n",
    "## Problem Description and Data Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "I was tasked with creating an algorithm to identify metastatic cancer in small image patches taken from larger digital pathology scans. This is a binary image classification problem, where I needed to determine whether the center 32x32px region of a patch contains at least one pixel of tumor tissue.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Dataset Description:\n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset I used is a modified version of the PatchCamelyon (PCam) benchmark dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The images are 96x96px RGB patches.\n",
    "- The center 32x32px region of each image determines the label.\n",
    "- A positive label indicates the presence of at least one tumor pixel in the center region.\n",
    "- The dataset does not contain duplicate images.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Data Statistics:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Training set**: 220,025 images\n",
    "- **Test set**: 57,458 images\n",
    "- **Image format**: .tif files\n",
    "- **Labels**: Binary (0 for non-tumor, 1 for tumor)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Project Significance and Use Case\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal of this project is to create a reliable model that can assist pathologists in detecting cancerous regions in histopathologic images. The significance lies in speeding up the diagnosis process, improving accuracy, and potentially saving lives by allowing for early detection of cancerous tissue. In real-world applications, this type of model could be deployed in hospitals to automate or assist in the screening of biopsies, reducing the workload on medical professionals and improving diagnostic throughput. With cancer being one of the leading causes of death worldwide, an automated detection system could have a huge impact on healthcare efficiency and patient outcomes. This type of deep learning solution could also be extended to various types of cancers, broadening its utility across different medical fields.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Model Selection and Approach\n",
    "\n",
    "Instead of relying solely on pre-established models like ResNet or EfficientNet, I decided to focus on designing a **custom CNN model** for this problem. While pre-trained models have been successful across various domains, this project gave me an opportunity to see how well I could do by building a model specifically tailored to the characteristics of my dataset. Custom CNN architectures provide the flexibility to adjust hyperparameters like the number of layers, filter sizes, and dropout rates, which could lead to better optimization for my specific task. By doing this, I aimed to compare the performance of my custom CNN to that of widely recognized models, like ResNet and EfficientNet, and understand how a carefully designed model can compete with established architectures. \n",
    "\n",
    "This approach not only allowed me to better understand the intricacies of model design but also gave me greater control over the feature extraction process, allowing for a more specialized solution for detecting cancer in histopathologic images."

    "1. **Class distribution**:\n",
    "   - The dataset is slightly imbalanced:\n",

    "   - All images are in RGB format (3 channels).\n",
    "\n",
    "   ![Sample Images](visualizations/Sample_Images.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Pixel intensity distribution**:\n",
    "   - The pixel intensity distribution is right-skewed, with a peak near the higher intensity values (200-250).\n",
    "   - There’s also a smaller peak at lower intensities (0-50), likely representing darker regions in the images.\n",
    "   - This suggests good contrast in the images, which could be helpful for distinguishing features.\n",

    "   ![Pixel Intensity Distribution](visualizations/Pixel_Intensity_Distribution.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Color distribution across channels**:\n",

    "\n",
    "   ![Color Distribution](visualizations/color_distribution.png)\n",

    "1. **Data augmentation** to address the slight class imbalance. Techniques such as random rotations, flips, and shifts will be applied.\n",
    "2. **Image preprocessing** using the cropping and super-resolution technique. Images are cropped to 32x32 and then resized to 224x224 using the ESRGAN super-resolution model.\n",
    "3. **Pixel normalization** to improve model convergence. Given the skewed pixel intensity distribution, normalization techniques like histogram equalization might be beneficial.\n",
    "4. **CNN architecture** optimized for 224x224 RGB images, based on the consistent image size after preprocessing.\n",
    "5. **Stratified k-fold cross-validation** to ensure representative class distribution across folds.\n",
    "6. **Attention mechanisms** or similar techniques will be explored to focus on areas of dense cell distribution, which seem indicative of tumor presence.\n",
    "7. **Transfer learning** using pre-trained models such as ResNet or EfficientNetB0, leveraging their ability to process RGB images with the given resolution.\n",
    "8. **Learning rate scheduling and early stopping** to manage training dynamics carefully, given the subtle differences between the two classes."

    "### Image Preprocessing with Super-Resolution and Cropping\n",
    "\n",
    "In the dataset provided, each image is a 96x96 pixel RGB patch, and the critical information used to determine whether a tumor is present lies in the **center 32x32 region**. Specifically, the tumor label is defined by whether or not there is at least **one tumor pixel in that 32x32 region**. Thus, the information that is most relevant for classification resides in a relatively small portion of the overall image. \n",
    "\n",
    "To leverage this, I implemented a smart preprocessing approach that focuses on cropping the center 32x32 region of each image and applying **super-resolution techniques** to increase the resolution to 224x224. This approach has several advantages:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Key Steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Center Cropping**: \n",
    "   - I first crop the **32x32 pixel region** from the center of each 96x96 image.\n",
    "   - This ensures that I am focusing only on the region that is critical for classification (i.e., the area where tumor pixels are present or absent).\n",
    "   \n",
    "2. **Super-Resolution**: \n",
    "   - After cropping, the 32x32 pixel region is passed through an **ESRGAN** (Enhanced Super-Resolution Generative Adversarial Network) model, which increases the resolution of the image to **224x224**.\n",
    "   - By doing this, I allow our deep learning models to have **better access to fine-grained details** that may otherwise be lost in a low-resolution image, such as subtle variations in cell structures or tissue textures.\n",
    "   \n",
    "3. **Resizing**:\n",
    "   - After applying super-resolution, the images are resized using a **LANCZOS filter**, ensuring smooth scaling to a final resolution of **224x224**.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Why This Approach is Effective:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Focusing on the Relevant Region**:\n",
    "   - By cropping the center 32x32 region, I eliminate extraneous information that is not relevant to the task (i.e., tissue areas that do not impact the classification).\n",
    "   - This ensures that the models are only trained on **the most critical region** of each image, allowing them to learn more effectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Enhancing Visual Detail**:\n",
    "   - The center region, although crucial, is originally very low in resolution (32x32). If used directly, it may not provide sufficient detail for models to accurately classify the presence of tumors.\n",
    "   - **Super-resolution** techniques help to restore some of the lost details in the original image, allowing models to make more informed decisions. Features that may be blurry or unclear in the low-resolution 32x32 image become sharper and easier for the model to detect in the super-resolved version.\n",
    "   \n",
    "3. **Improving Model Performance**:\n",
    "   - Deep learning models, particularly those used in computer vision, are often optimized for higher-resolution images. By resizing to 224x224, I ensure that the input matches the typical input sizes of common architectures (e.g., ResNet, EfficientNet).\n",
    "   - Higher resolution input also allows models to detect **subtle patterns** and textures that may not be discernible in smaller, lower-resolution images.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Efficient Use of GPU Resources**:\n",
    "   - By using a **super-resolution model** (ESRGAN) in combination with GPU resources, I was able to efficiently process thousands of images and prepare them for training.\n",
    "   - This allowed me to strike a balance between **performance** (processing time) and **accuracy** (image quality)."

    "1. Custom CNN (Total params: 61,185 - 239.00 KB): \n",
    "   - Establishes a baseline performance.\n",
    "   - Added BatchNormalization layers to help with the varying pixel intensities we observed.\n",
    "   - Used GlobalAveragePooling2D to reduce parameters and maintain spatial information.\n",
    "   - Added Dropout for regularization, considering the relatively small dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. ResNet50 (Total params: 25,686,913 - 97.99 MB): \n",
    "   - Known for its ability to train very deep networks effectively.\n",
    "   - The residual connections can help in capturing fine-grained details in histopathology images.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. EfficientNetB0 (Total params: 5,362,340 - 20.46 MB): \n",
    "   - Offers a good balance between model size and performance.\n",
    "   - Particularly efficient for smaller image sizes like our 96x96 pixels.\n",
    "\n",
    "For all models:\n",
    "- I am using a sigmoid activation for the final layer, suitable for our binary classification task.\n",
    "- I added Dropout layers in the fully connected parts of the networks to prevent overfitting.\n",
    "- The input shape is set to (96, 96, 3) to match our image properties.\n",
    "- For transfer learning models (ResNet50 and EfficientNetB0), we're initially freezing the base layers to leverage pre-trained weights, as evidenced by the large number of non-trainable parameters.\n",
    "\n",
    "The significant difference in model sizes highlights the trade-off between model complexity and potential performance, with our custom CNN being the smallest and ResNet50 being the largest.\n",

    "In the training phase, we'll implement data augmentation to address the slight class imbalance and increase model robustness. We'll also use callbacks for learning rate adjustment and early stopping to fine-tune the training process."

This method maintains the proportion of class labels in each fold, accounting for the slight class imbalance present in the dataset.

    "### Hyperparameter Tuning and Final Model Training\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Overview\n",
    "This code block focuses on the hyperparameter tuning of the **Custom CNN** model and training the final model using the optimal hyperparameters. It builds upon the previous model evaluations and the successful use of preprocessed data, especially from the `train_preprocessed/` directory, where images were **cropped to the center 32x32 of the original 96x96 size** and then **enhanced using a super-resolution method** to resize them to 224x224 pixels.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Components from Previous Code Blocks\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Data**: \n",
    "   - Utilizes the `train_preprocessed/` images that were processed by cropping the center of the original images and then using a resolution increase function based on ESRGAN to resize them to 224x224. \n",
    "   - `train_labels` is used to provide labels for training, while `PREPROCESSED_TRAIN_PATH` points to the location of the preprocessed images.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Functions**:\n",
    "   - `create_generators()`: Used to create data generators for training and validation, ensuring consistent batch processing and augmentation.\n",
    "   - `custom_cnn_preprocess()`: Used for image preprocessing, including normalization and any additional augmentations.\n",
    "   - `plot_learning_curves()`: Visualizes the model's performance metrics over epochs.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### New Functions and Classes\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **F1ScoreMetric**:\n",
    "   - A custom Keras metric class to compute the **F1 score** during training and validation, providing a crucial balance between precision and recall.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **PrintValMetricsCallback**:\n",
    "   - A callback that prints key validation metrics (loss, accuracy, and F1 score) at the end of each epoch, giving insights into model performance after each training cycle.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **build_custom_cnn_model(hp)**:\n",
    "   - This function builds a **Custom CNN** model for **hyperparameter tuning**, allowing flexible tuning of:\n",
    "     - The number of convolutional and dense layers\n",
    "     - The number of filters, units, kernel sizes\n",
    "     - Dropout rates and learning rate\n",
    "   - It integrates with Keras Tuner for optimal architecture search based on the training data.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Main Process\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Data Preparation**:\n",
    "   - The dataset is split into `train_tune` and `val_tune` for hyperparameter tuning, using the **preprocessed images** to ensure consistent input size and quality.\n",
    "   - **train_preprocessed/** images are used throughout, which were first cropped and then enhanced using the ESRGAN super-resolution method, improving the training effectiveness on higher resolution inputs.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Hyperparameter Tuning**:\n",
    "   - Utilizes **Keras Tuner's Hyperband algorithm** to search for optimal hyperparameters, with the objective of maximizing validation **F1-score**.\n",
    "   - The **TqdmProgressCallback** provides a visual progress bar during training.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Best Model Selection**:\n",
    "   - The best hyperparameters are retrieved after the tuning process, optimizing the Custom CNN's architecture based on **AUC**, **F1-score**, and other metrics.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **K-fold Cross-Validation**:\n",
    "   - **Stratified K-fold cross-validation** (3 folds) is performed to ensure robust model evaluation, providing insights into the model's generalization ability across different folds.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Final Model Training**:\n",
    "   - The final model is trained using the entire dataset after tuning, incorporating **early stopping** and **learning rate scheduling** to prevent overfitting.\n",
    "   - The final model, including its weights, is saved for future evaluation and deployment.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Model Saving and Evaluation**:\n",
    "   - The best performing model is saved as `final_custom_cnn_model_1.keras`.\n",
    "   - **Learning curves** are plotted to visualize the model's training and validation performance, showing trends in accuracy, AUC, precision, recall, and F1-score.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Accomplishments\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Preprocessing**: Utilized advanced preprocessing methods, including **cropping the center 32x32 pixels of the images** and applying **super-resolution** techniques to upsample the images to 224x224 for improved input quality.\n",
    "2. **Hyperparameter Optimization**: Explored a wide range of model architectures and hyperparameters to optimize the Custom CNN.\n",
    "3. **Cross-Validation**: Performed thorough cross-validation, ensuring that the model generalizes well across different subsets of the data.\n",
    "4. **Performance Visualization**: Plotted the learning curves and final validation metrics, providing insights into model performance over epochs.\n",
    "\n",
    "This code block takes the success of the Custom CNN from previous steps and systematically refines it through hyperparameter optimization and preprocessing improvements. The preprocessing steps, particularly the image resolution enhancement, provided a solid foundation for improved performance."

    "## Summary of Test Data Prediction and Submission Process\n",
    "\n",
    "In this step, I performed predictions on a test dataset using the **final custom CNN model** and saved the results in a format suitable for submission to Kaggle. I used **preprocessed test images** that were created through a specific series of transformations, including **center cropping** and **super-resolution enhancement**.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Model Summary**:  \n",
    "   The loaded model is a custom CNN, consisting of convolutional, batch normalization, pooling, and fully connected layers, designed for binary classification. The total number of parameters in the model is **10,204,037**, with trainable parameters making up around **3.4 million**.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Test Image Preprocessing**:  \n",
    "   The test images were processed in the following way:\n",
    "   - **Center Crop**: The central **32x32** region was cropped from the original **96x96** image to focus on the most important part of the image.\n",
    "   - **Super-Resolution Model**: I applied an **ESRGAN (Enhanced Super-Resolution GAN)** model to upscale the cropped image to a **224x224** resolution. This process was implemented using a TensorFlow Hub ESRGAN model to enhance the detail and quality of the cropped images before feeding them into the model for prediction.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Test Data Generator**:  \n",
    "   I created a test generator to preprocess the test images in batches (32 images per batch). The generator loaded **57,458 test samples** from the preprocessed directory for prediction.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Making Predictions**:  \n",
    "   Using the pre-trained model, predictions were made on the test set. The predictions were generated as probabilities, which were then converted to binary classifications (0 or 1) using the dynamically calculated **optimal threshold** of **0.4179**.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Submission Creation**:  \n",
    "   A submission file was created in the required CSV format for Kaggle. The file contains two columns:\n",
    "   - **id**: The ID of each test sample.\n",
    "   - **label**: The predicted class (0 or 1), derived using the optimal threshold.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Distribution of Predictions**:  \n",
    "   A plot showing the distribution of predictions revealed that:\n",

    "## Conclusion and Future Work\n",
    "\n",
    "In conclusion, this project successfully demonstrated the ability to design a custom CNN model capable of detecting metastatic cancer in histopathologic images with high precision and recall. Through careful model design, hyperparameter tuning, and image preprocessing techniques, I was able to achieve strong performance metrics that rivaled pre-trained models like ResNet and EfficientNet. This highlights the effectiveness of custom CNN models tailored specifically to a given dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Future Work\n",
    "\n",
    "Moving forward, several areas of improvement could be explored to further enhance the model’s performance:\n",
    "- **Ensemble Models**: Combining my custom CNN with other pre-trained models like ResNet and EfficientNet through ensemble techniques could lead to higher accuracy and robustness.\n",
    "- **Data Augmentation**: Applying more advanced data augmentation techniques could help the model generalize better by exposing it to more variations of the data.\n",
    "- **Transfer Learning**: Integrating transfer learning by fine-tuning pre-trained models could yield better results, especially with larger, more complex datasets.\n",
    "- **Explainability**: Incorporating techniques such as Grad-CAM or saliency maps could provide insights into what areas of the image the model focuses on, making it more interpretable for medical use.\n",
    "\n",
    "By addressing these points, this model could become an even more reliable tool for assisting in the early detection of cancer, potentially improving diagnostic accuracy in medical practice."
